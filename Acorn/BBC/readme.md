Power supply schematic for BBC Micro PSU Model AA11660

This schematic was put together from various sources. 
Mainly using the schematic from the BBC Service manual (Which is missing most of the component values)  and a schematic from the 
following forum:

I have also updated the component values after double checking them on a PSU. (Some values are still a mystery like C12 which is 
covered, and also coil values)

While every effort has been made to ensure the schematic is accurate, it might contain errors. 

If you find any please let me know or submit a PR
